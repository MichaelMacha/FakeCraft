Mission description before launch
Tips menu before beginning
    Tips can be cycled through
Narrative voice
    Robot lady
    Gives objectives
All missions are on a terrain
All missions have a set of objectives which must be completed to win
    - Could hypothetically be "eliminate all non-allied factions"
Mission objectives are always available in options menu
Fog of war shows exposed area
Right-click seems to do what's on button 7 (top-left)

Overlay:
Minimap in bottom right
Entity options in bottom right
Menu button next to Entity options
Readout in bottom center

X Plan: Have a global that keeps track of all common elements like the unit priority list, autoloaded at scene start
    -- manager.gd as Manager

Unit controls selection priority appears to be based on an internal list. Higher-queued units take priority over lower elements on the list.

Plan: ControlButton actions can do a lot of things, but typically change the behavior of the interface anticipating more parameters for the action.
    Modularize mouse behavior into its own node
    On triggering an action like "Walk" or later "Attack", delegate to a different interface node

Proposal: Put actions in sub node, each controlled by its own script
    Have these scripts be a subclass of "UnitControl" or something like that
    Have each UnitControl keep a reference to its place in the 9-button overlay

Unit control:
    Right-click moves
        Note: move is top-left command (button 7), possibly related
        <<Not related; SCVs will mine minerals when right-clicked but won't when moved onto>>
        Right-click perhaps has particular associations with an action depending on unit
    Shift Right-click adds waypoints to a stack
    Unit moves in its own manner toward that point

    Mechanic Suggestion:
        Keep queue of points to move to
        Push point onto queue when moving
            (Remember to implement behavior in button)
        Right click to do button 7

        _physics_process:
            If no target point or target point empty:
                When queue is not empty:
                    Pop item off of queue into target point
            Navigate to target point
            Move along navigation path from NavAgent3D.


Resources:
Minerals:
    Mined from actual tiles
        Tile graphic relates to quantity remaining
Vespene:
    Retrieved from refinery
Population:
    Ratio of usage to current supply depots
    Must be < 1.0 for new units to be built which have pop requirement
    Can be sabotaged with supply depot destruction

Identifiable terrain features:
    Walls/Levels
    Minerals
    Vespene Gas
Identifiable faction control:
    Buildings
    Units

Identified buildings:
    Command Center
    Supply Depot

Command Center abilities:
    Create SCV
    Set rally point
    Can receive resources from SCVs

Supply Depot provides population support
    Robot voice lets you know when you don't have enough

Refinery abilities:
    Creates refined vespene (from limited raw vespene from source)
    Can hold one SCV at a time while gathering gas

Identified units:
    SCV
    Marine
Select with left mouse, right click to command
Universal unit abilities:
    Move
    Hold Position
    Attack


SCV abilities:
    60 HP
    Mine crystal
    Construct
        Gives list of potential buildings
        Only one SCV can build at a time
    Mine vespene
    Can carry resource

M := Mineral
P := Supply Depot
V := Vespene
T := Game Seconds

Units have a cost:
    SCV: 50 M 1 P 20 T

Buildings have a cost:
    Supply Depot: 100 M, 40 T
        + 8 P
    Vespene Gas Refinery: 100 M
        - Must be built on Vespene geyser
    Command Center: 400 M 120 T
        + 10 P

Mission Success procedure:
See if requirements are met
    (Ex. Still have agency on map, like units and buildings; key entities are still alive, etc.)
    True:
        Check objective list
        If all complete:
            Succeed
        Else:
            Mission ongoing
    False:
        Fail mission

Procedure suspicions:
Everything that can flag an objective emits a signal
Signal updates record of mission state and runs success check
